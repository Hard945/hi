# Large Dense 1,600 Pop 15 Hour World - _Created by Rhobot_ 
This ambitiously large 1910u simulation has resulted in an explosion of 1600 visually diverse herbivore bibites after 15 hours of run time.  Even with a reduced biomass density of 27.1mE/u2, the high 6.60 pellet concentration has sustained the significant bibite population.

*Be warned!* Only the highest performing computers will be able to run this world at a rate faster than 5 FPS.  If your computer is up for the task, it would be interesting to see how this world evolves given more time.  Share your progress with the community on one of the social media platforms and we will post the updated world here.
