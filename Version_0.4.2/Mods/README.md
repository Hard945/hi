# Modding
Modding will be done through adding the **downloaded unzipped mod folder** to the Mods folder in the game's root directory. The can be found in the following path starting from the game's executable:

**Windows (32x, 64x) and Linux:** <path to executable folder>/The Bibites_Data/Mods/

**Mac:** <path to player app bundle>/Contents/Mods/

**Note:** *Those folders will only be generated after the game was opened at least once. So if you can't find them, run the game, then close it. It should then be there.*

For more information a complete "How-to" guide is maintained on the Bibite wiki page: [Bibites_Modding](https://the-bibites.fandom.com/wiki/Modding)
