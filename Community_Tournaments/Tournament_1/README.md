## Free for all Qualifcation Round Information
The tournament world will be started and immediately paused. 5 Bibites of each submission, tagged with their species name, will then be randomly and uniformaly distributed into the world. Once each submission is added to the world it will be resumed at 1x speed.  The world will then be simulated for 1hr or until only sixteen contestant Bibite species remain. If more than 16 Bibite species remain at 1hr, the simulation will be stopped and the total energy of each remaining bibite species population will be summed. The 16 Bibite species with the highest total population energy will move on to the next competition round.
