## Submission Information
All submissions should be completed using the Bibite submission *form*.  Submissions will be reviewed, assigned at tag and nursed to a reasonable health and maturity before they are added to competition. Submitting healthy, mature bibites is encouraged.

## Free-for-all Qualifcation Round Information
The free-for-all tournament world will be started and immediately paused. 5 Bibites of each submission, tagged with their species name, will then be randomly and uniformaly distributed into the world. Once each submission is added to the world it will be resumed at 1x speed.  The world will then be simulated for 1hr or until only sixteen contestant Bibite species remain. At this time the total energy of each remaining bibite species population will be summed. The 16 Bibite species with the highest total population energy will move on to the next competition round. The total population energies will also be used to determine seeding for the next round.

## Single Loss Elimination 16 Bibite Bracket Round Information
For each 1v1 battle, a new 1v1 tournament world will be started and immediately paused. 10 Bibites of each contestant, tagged with their species name, will then be randomly and uniformaly distributed into the world. Once each submission is added to the world it will be resumed at 1x speed.  The world will then be simulated for 1hr or until only one Bibite species remains. If both Bibite species remain at 1hr, the simulation will be stopped and the total energy of each remaining bibite species population will be summed. The Bibite species with the highest total population energy will be declared the victor
